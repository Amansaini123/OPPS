tho virtual base class ye try krta hai ki sirf ek hi copy aaye parent class se naa ki ek se zadda This is also known as virtual inheritance 
syntax is           lass  Derived_Class : Visibilty_Mode Virtual Parent_Class


// BENEFITES OF OPPS
Through inhertiance we can eliminate the reducdaant code
System can be easlity upgraded
Secure progrms as data hiding
